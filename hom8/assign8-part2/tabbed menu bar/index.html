                        <h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
                    Learning outcomes are statements of what students will learn in a class or in a class session. The statements are focused on student learning (What will students learn today?) rather than instructor teaching (What am I going to teach today?). These statements should include a verb phrase and an impact ("in order to") phrase -- what students will do/be able to do and how they will apply that skill or knowledge. There are some verbs to avoid when writing learning outcomes. These verbs are vague and often not observable or measurable. For example, how would you measure whether someone has "become familiar with" a particular tool? Use a more specific verb. If you want students to "understand" something, think more closely about what you want them to be able to do or produce as a result of their "understanding."

                        <h4>Learning Modules</h4>
                    Learning Module is a tool that provides course materials in a logical, sequential, order, guiding students through the content and assessments in the order specified by the instructor. Instructors can insert formatted text, files, weblinks, Discussion Topics, Assignments, Tests and Quizzes, and soon, Assessments. Content can be structured in such a way as to require students to complete content before they are allowed to proceed to the next content. It is also possible for instructors to set up a place for students to add content to the Learning Module.
